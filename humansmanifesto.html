<h1>Humans Manifesto</h1>
<p>No plan survives first contact with the
enemy. <br>
<br>
<br>
Sometimes being dumb is the only
smart alternative. <br>
<br>
<br>
Shy people are secretly
egoists. <br>
<br>
<br>
Nothing is real. <br>
<br>
<br>
Everything you see is
a dream
you project onto the world. <br>
<br>
<br>
Children live out
their parents unconscious.<br>
<br>
The only animals
that suffer from anxiety are the ones that
associate with Humans Manifesto.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don’t trust
people who are very articulate.<br>
<br>
The only way
to be sane is to embrace your sanity.<br>
<br>
<br>
When
you feel guilty about being sad, remember
Walt Disney was a manic depressive.<br>
<br>
<br>

Everything I said could be totally wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
Everything is transient.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://mikemillsmikemills.com/">Everything is a process not an object.<a/>
<br> <br>
Be more positive.<br>
<br>

Try to stop anthropomorphizing the animals
I know, or at least do it less.<br>
<br>
<br>
Play games that require abandon. <br>
<br>
<br>Get better
at maintaining relationships with friends.<br>
<br>
<br>
Look at how I’m not fully conscious of my real
life, admit that I’m groping in the dark,
overwhelmed by the consequences of my
acts and that at every moment I’m faced with
outcomes I did not intend.”
